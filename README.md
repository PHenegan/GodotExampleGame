# GodotExampleGame

This game was a result of following the Tutorial made by GDQuest on Youtube.

 - [GDQuest's github repository](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-beginner-2d-platformer)


There were also a few additional modifications that I made:
 - I implemented double jump to see if I had an understanding of what was going on
 - hitboxes should be more precise
 - The actual levels are different
 
 Other minor changes:
 - Max player speed isn't the same as the speed from inputs
 - There is a max movement speed that is actually enforced aside from the speed determined from the inputs

There will probably be more changes in the future, specifically to the movement and world interaction
 - I kind of want to make a Celeste-type platformer at some point, so I might use this project to playtest different styles of movement through jumping and others
